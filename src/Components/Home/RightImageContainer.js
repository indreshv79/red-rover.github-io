                        <p>Pete Warhurst sold PODS in 2007 but, since then, he has never stopped thinking about ways to
                            improve the model. He believed so much in his ideas that he decided to start a new moving and
                            storage company and do the initial funding from his own pocket. Less than three years later, Red
                            Rover has opened 20 locations in 14 cities across the US and attracted almost $70 million in
                            investment including a financing round led by Oppenheimer and Co.
